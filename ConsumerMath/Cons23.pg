$PAR
 When purchasing a house, a buyer will typically use a$BBOLD homeowner's mortgage,$EBOLD which is a long  term loan where the property being purchased is collateral. That is, if the buyer defaults on the loan (doesnâ€™t pay it),  then  the  bank  claims  the  property 
$BR
$BR
Two kinds of up-front payment a buyer might make in obtaining a mortgage are a$BBOLD down payment$EBOLD and$BBOLD points.$EBOLD 
The down payment is a payment directly to the seller of the property of a certain percentage of the cost;  this reduces the total amount that must be financed, reducing the size of the mortgage. Points are a  payment to the bank, not the seller of the property, of a certain percentage of the mortgage interest. Each point is one percent of the mortgage amount. This is prepaid interest.
